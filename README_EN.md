## 🌟 Introduction

**Ragflow-Plus** is a secondary development project based on **Ragflow**, aiming to address practical application issues with the following features:

- **Management Mode**  
  An additional backend management system is provided for user, team, config, file, and knowledge base management.

- **Permission Restriction**  
  The frontend interface is simplified by reducing user access permissions.

- **Enhanced Parsing**  
  Replaces the DeepDoc algorithm with **MinerU** for improved file parsing and support for image analysis.

- **Image & Text Output**  
  Supports linking reference images to answer text blocks during responses.

- **Document Writing Mode**  
  Offers a brand-new interactive document editing experience.

- **Start the backend**: Navigate to `management/server` and run:
```bash
python app.py
```

- **Start the frontend**: Navigate to `management/web` and run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Start the Frontend Interaction System:
- **Start the backend**: From the project root directory, run:
```bash
python -m api.ragflow_server
```

- **Start the frontend**: Navigate to `web` and run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
