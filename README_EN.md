## üåü Introduction

**Ragflow-Plus** is a secondary development project based on **Ragflow**, aiming to solve some issues in real-world applications.  
Key features include:

- **Management Mode**  
  An additional admin panel to support user management, team management, configuration management, file management, and knowledge base management.
- **Permission Reclaiming**  
  The frontend system limits user permissions for a simplified interface.
- **Enhanced Parsing**  
  Replaces the DeepDoc algorithm with MinerU for better document parsing results, including image parsing.
- **Text-Image Output**  
  Supports displaying related images linked to referenced text blocks in model responses.
- **Document Writing Mode**  
  Offers a brand new document-mode interactive experience.

**In short:** Ragflow-Plus is the ‚Äúindustry-specific solution‚Äù of Ragflow for Chinese application scenarios.
